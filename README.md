# 🧠 Data Science Mini Projects
Welcome to my collection of mini data science projects! Each project is implemented using Python and Jupyter Notebooks, showcasing various machine learning, data visualization, and clustering techniques.

📁 Project List
1. 📊 3D Data Visualization
Description: Visualizes multi-dimensional data using 3D plots for better interpretation and insight.

Key Concepts: matplotlib, seaborn, mpl_toolkits, 3D scatter plots, data interpretation.

Use Case: Understand clustering or grouping patterns in 3D feature spaces.

2. 🌌 Manifold Visualization
Description: Applies dimensionality reduction techniques like t-SNE and Isomap to high-dimensional datasets.

Key Concepts: scikit-learn, t-SNE, Isomap, dimensionality reduction, visualization of complex data manifolds.

Use Case: Visualizing intrinsic structures of datasets in lower dimensions.

3. ✉️ SVM Spam Detection
Description: Builds a binary classifier using Support Vector Machines (SVM) to detect spam messages.

Key Concepts: scikit-learn, SVM, text vectorization (TfidfVectorizer), confusion matrix, accuracy.

Dataset Used: SMS Spam Collection dataset.

Use Case: Classifying text messages into "spam" or "ham".

4. 🧪 K-Means Clustering
Description: Applies the K-Means clustering algorithm to group data into clusters based on similarity.

Key Concepts: scikit-learn, elbow method, silhouette score, data preprocessing, clustering.

Use Case: Customer segmentation, pattern detection, unsupervised grouping.

🛠 Requirements
To run these notebooks, install the following Python packages:

    pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

For manifold learning:

    pip install umap-learn

🚀 Getting Started
Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name

Launch Jupyter Notebook:

    jupyter notebook
